# SET COVERING WITH A* ALGORITHM

This is an attempt to solve the set covering problem using the A* algorithm. 

As we know, the A* algorithm tries to look for the best solution by the adoption of an heuristic function used to select the most promising path. In this case I tried different possible heuristics. The first heuristic (compute_min_tiles) is based on the minimum number of tiles required to fill all the remaining blocks. The second one (compute_min_tiles1) is very similar to the first one, but  instead of being based  on the number of missing blocks it actually stops when the whole set is filled. The third heuristic (compute_min_tiles2) actually computes how many tiles are required to cover the entire set. It's more expensive than the others and it's also not an estimation. The fourth heuristic (compute_min_tiles3) is sorting the tiles based on the number of non overlapped blocks with respect to the initial state (the less covered blocks are not overlapped, the better). The final heuristic (compute_min_tiles4) is similar to the previous one but it's sorting the tiles based on how different they are with respect of the initial state(implemented with a XOR function).
